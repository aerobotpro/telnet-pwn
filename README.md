# telnet-pwn
My DEPICTION Of A Command Line Tool For Automating The Exploitation/Hijacking Of Cisco And Other Vulnerable Telnet Services.
Not sure if this really works but it should never be used for illegal/immoral purposes!
If you attempt to scan the internet you will probably go to jail!

### Requirements:
> `Python3.6` Or Greater.

### Installation:
